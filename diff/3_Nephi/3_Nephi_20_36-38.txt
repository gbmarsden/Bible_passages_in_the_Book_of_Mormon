Book of Mormon
3 Nephi Chapter 20

36 And then shall be brought to pass that which is written: Awake, awake again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.

38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye have sold yourselves for naught, and ye shall be redeemed without money.
